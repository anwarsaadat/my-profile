            I take immense pride in the various projects I have undertaken during my academic career. These projects not
            only showcase my skills and expertise but also highlight my passion for applying theoretical knowledge to
            real-world challenges. Some notable projects include are as follows:

        <h2>Automated Water Tank Level Indicator - <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: 400;">BS, Semester
            Based Project</span></h2>
        <div class="description">
          <p>
            In this project, I conceptualized and developed an automated system with the primary function of monitoring
            and displaying the water level within a tank. The key objectives were to introduce efficiency, convenience,
            and sustainability into water usage. By automating the monitoring process, we aimed to achieve two important
            outcomes: the conservation of water resources and the reduction of energy consumption.

          <p>
            The Library Management Desktop Application was meticulously crafted to revolutionize the way libraries
            operate and manage their resources. At its core, this application seamlessly integrated a robust SQL
            database system
            with an intuitive Java user interface powered by JavaFX, creating a powerful tool that elevated library
            management
            to new heights.

            The Interactive Student Discussion Platform served as a digital space where students could engage in
            meaningful
            discourse, share knowledge, and exchange ideas. This innovative application harnessed the power of Java
            programming in
            conjunction with Oracle databases to create a robust and user-friendly tool for educational interaction.

        <div class="description">
          <p>
            My FYP thesis was dedicated to the creation of an innovative recommendation system designed to enhance the
            user experience by providing personalized and context-aware POI recommendations. Leveraging the power of
            graph embedding, our proposed model exhibited substantial advancements in accuracy and performance when compared
            to existing methodologies.

            My work delves into the intricacies of POI recommendations, recognizing that the quality of recommendations is
            significantly enhanced by considering associated features. These features encompass a wide range of contextual
            information, including user preferences, historical interactions, location data, and more. My research aimed to harness
            this wealth of information to provide highly accurate and context-aware POI recommendations.
